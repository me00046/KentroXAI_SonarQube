# Reasoning Report

**Project:** sample-trusted-ai-project  
**Run ID:** 20260218T143752Z  
**Risk Tier:** Medium

## Executive Overview

This artifact explains decision behavior, source grounding, and governance implications without exposing chain-of-thought reasoning.

## Prompt and Response Snapshot

- Prompt: Summarize the policy update.
- Model Output: Stub model response: real provider integration is pending. TODO: connect Azure OpenAI or another model endpoint.
- Citation Coverage: 0.0
- Transparency Risk: High

## Intended Use and Scope

- Intended Use: Internal policy and quality checks
- Primary Task: classification
- Out-of-Scope: High-risk deployment without human review and controls.

## Data Summary

- Dataset: sample_customer_data
- Source: local_csv
- Sensitive Features: ['gender', 'age_bucket']
- Limitations: Synthetic records for demonstration

## Model Summary

- Model Name: sample_classifier
- Version: 0.1.0
- Owner: responsible-ai-team
- Known Failures: ['Edge cases may be unstable']

## Evidence-Linked Evaluation Summary
### Suite: medium
- accuracy_stub: value=0.81, threshold=0.7, pass=True
- reliability: value=0.83, threshold=0.75, pass=True
- fairness_demographic_parity_diff: value=-0.2, threshold=0.2, pass=True

## Source Trace
- ctx-none: No retrieved sources provided

## Explainability Approach
- Feature attribution (planned integration)
- Counterfactual reasoning (planned integration)
- Global behavior summaries (planned integration)

## Escalation Cues
- Escalate if transparency risk is high.
- Escalate if scorecard go/no-go status is no-go.
- Escalate if high or critical red-team findings remain open.

## Governance Controls
- Intended use and misuse boundaries are defined.
- Known limitations and failure modes are documented.
- Evaluation and threshold criteria are documented.
- Security testing outputs are tracked as review evidence.
- Human review remains required for deployment approval.
- TODO: integrate model-specific explainability library.
- TODO: attach reproducible explanation samples for representative cohorts.

## Limitations and Open Questions

- Evidence links should be replaced with real experiment artifacts in production.
- Human review and legal/compliance sign-off are required before deployment.
